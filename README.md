# isbn-indexer
Used to resolve ISBN information against APIs.  Currently supports OpenLibrary and ISBN DB.

The scripts/create_book_csv.py will take a list of ISBNs and create a CSV with information.

# Background
I wrote this in order to complete my [IS 445 Data Visualization Final Project](https://github.com/kayavila/IS445-Final-StorybookBibles).  It was used to generate the initial dataset.
